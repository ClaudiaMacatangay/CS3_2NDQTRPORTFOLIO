      <h3>What is a Seafood Boil?</h3>
      <p>
        A seafood boil brings a scanty and festive ambiance to the table. In a pot filled with seasoning and water, 
        the seafood (for example, shrimp, crab, and mussels) are all together with some delicious veggies such as corn 
        and potatoes. The seafood is commonly boiled in a savory broth or water with seasonings and then mixed with 
        either garlic-butter or Cajun-style spices. What makes the seafood boil special is not just its rich buttery 
        flavor but also the way it is eaten communally — the food is usually poured on a paper-covered table and everyone 
        puts their hands in to get their share.

        A dish can differ from one region to another: in some areas, it is doused with a rich garlic-butter sauce while in 
        others it is hot with Cajun spices and still others use smoked sausage to give it a nice salty and savory taste.
        Seafood boils are not only consumed during festivities, but also at home on the porch and during family get-togethers
        because they unite people around the same large and cheerful meal.

      <h3>Why I Love Seafood Boil</h3>
      <p>
        Seafood boil is my favorite dish since it makes every meal to a communal event full of laughter and good food. 
        I still remember my first seafood boil when I was cracking crab legs and dipping shrimp into extra garlic butter 
        at the same time everyone was talking about their favorite parts. The mix of textures — tender seafood, soft 
        potatoes, and sweet corn —combined with rich, buttery seasoning makes each bite irresistible. More than just 
        flavor, the whole experience feels warm and communal; it’s a food that invites conversation and creates memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        A seafood boil might be the best option when it comes to serving a large group of people or it might just be a
        small family gathering; it is still always a crowd-pleaser. I like to think of it as the most customizable dish
        — add more seafood, adjust the heat, or change the sides — so each boil can be made according to the taste of its
        consumers. One of the best things about seafood boil to me is that it is both comfort food and celebration all
        mixed up in one big pot.

        you prefer to highlight.
